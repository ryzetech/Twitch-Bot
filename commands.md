This is a list of the commands the bot uses. Feel free to ask questions if you have them! :)

**Important:** Stuff in \<spiky> brackets has to be specified, stuff in \[square] brackets can be specified, but is not required to run the command.

# Basic Commands
### help
This command brings you to this very page. Quite thrilling if you ask me!

### dice \[dX]
Lets you throw a dice. X can be any number to simulate more sides. The default is six sides.  
For example, `!dice d20` throws a 20 sided die.
`!dice` just throws a six-sided die.

### 8ball \[question]
You can see the future! Well, not really, but let's pretend that you can.  
Ask the Magic 8 Ball a question, for example `!8ball Am I ugly?` and get something back like `"As I see it, yes"`.

*Wait a minute...*

### fact
Enjoy a random fact from the depths of the Internet! There is really not much more to it.

### quote [id]
Lists one of the quotes gathered by the mods over time. Every quote has an ID, so if you are looking for a specific one, you can do ith with the ID!

### coins
Shows how many coins you have. You can earn coins by chatting and playing games!

### lurk
Thanks you for stopping by and reminds you to bring cookies and coffee. You should definitely do that!

# Games
There are some games available to you. Why should you play it? Easy: Money! Well, coins... lol...

### connect4
Ever played Connect 4? Yup, that's the game! With this command, whenever displayed on stream, you can create a new game of Connect 4, which is played in the stream window.  
Type `!connect4` to start or join a game. Make moves by sending the number of the column in chat. First to connect four wins 150 coins!

# Environment Control
You can control my room!

### light \[color]
You can check the state of the light by typing `!light`. But that's boring!  
Control the light by writing a color as an argument, e.g. `!light green`.  
You can also use hex codes: `!light #bada55`  
This action will cost you 50 coins.

# Welcome Sounds
Those sounds can only be played by their owner to notify me that they arrived. If you want a sound, contact me! You probably know my Discord tag :p
